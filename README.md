# Pneumonia-Detection-from-Chest-X-Ray-Images-with-Deep-Learning

## DESCRIPTION
The aim of this study is to simplify the pneumonia detection process for experts as well as for novices. We suggest a novel deep learning framework for the detection of pneumonia using the concept of transfer learning. In this approach, features from images are extracted using different neural network models pretrained on ImageNet, which then are fed into a classifier for prediction.

## METHOD
We plan to detect Pneumonia and other abnormalities from Chest X-Ray images using Custom Deep Convolutional Neural Network and by retraining the pretrained model “InceptionV3”.
